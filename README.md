# desperate-defenders

Welcome to the project repository for my code for Desperate Defenders! This project is part of a project required by one of my modules in school.

## About the project

The following is lifted from the assignment brief for the project:

> **Background**
>
> Develop a tower defence game called Desperate Defenders.
>
> **Scope**
>
> Undead creatures are attacking the city! Position your units to protect the city until you have killed enough of the creatures to drive them off.
>
> In this “tower defence” strategy game, monsters are advancing on the city from right to left across 5 lanes. To kill the monsters, you have to purchase units and place them on the field of battle so that they can shoot or block the monsters. However, you start with 10 gold and only get 1 gold per turn, so spend your precious resources wisely!

This project is made in Python and contains all the code required in [main.py](https://github.com/arashnrim/desperate-defenders/blob/main/main.py).
